<h2>Src-old - Scrover's old Web intstance Source Code</h2>
<p>This is an open source code for Scrover's <b>OLD</b> web instance that is a fork of ScratchR.</p>
<p>It uses a VM that runs the site from localhost, and NGROK/playit to port it to a public web server.</p>
<p>Because of Github's file limit is up to <b>25MB</b>, the files can't be kept in github. Instead, you can download it <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J8fdrjaDkpPXQRc5OvRwGyOEJyUTL-wJ/view?usp=sharing">here.</a>
  <p>An aditional README is in the folder AFTER you unzip the "zip" file.</p>

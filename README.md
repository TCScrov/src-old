<h2>Src-old - Scrover's old Web intstance Source Code</h2>
<p>This is an open source code for Scrover's <b>OLD</b> web instance that is a fork of ScratchR.</p>
<p>Note that this is only for showcasing of how Scrover used to run. It uses a VM that runs the site from localhost, and NGROK/playit to port it to a public web server.</p>
